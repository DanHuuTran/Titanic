# Titanic Data Analysis with Data Cleaning and Decision Tree Model

## Overview
This README file provides an overview of the Titanic Data Analysis project. The project involves exploring and analyzing the Titanic dataset, performing data cleaning, and building a decision tree model to predict survival.

## Dataset
The Titanic dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and data science. It contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including details such as age, gender, ticket class, and whether they survived or not.

## Project goals

    Data Exploration: Explore the Titanic dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
    Data Cleaning: Cleanse the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, and other data inconsistencies.
    Feature Engineering: Create new features or modify existing ones to improve the predictive power of the model.
    Data Visualization: Use graphs and charts to visualize relationships within the data and gain insights.
    Decision Tree Model: Build a decision tree model to predict passenger survival based on the available features.
